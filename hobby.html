<h2>Painting</h2>
<p>When I am not sketching designs in my laptop, I like to paint and do craft works. While in college, couple of my paintings were published in the <b>college magazine</b>. <br>
Painting is an art of playing with colors and textures. Since my childhood I have a great passion in painting which lead me to learn various types of painting like <span style="color: rgb(0,185,150);"> warli painting, tanjore painting, glass painting and metal embossing</span>. I like to make things out of nothing. My favorite website is <em><strong>DIY and Crafts</strong></em>. Since my childhood, my favorite hobby is to decorate my home interior with my art works. After moving to California, I started to decorate my interior house with <i>eco-friendly</i> paintings made by me. During this process, I was fascinated by the <i>eco-friendly</i> project ideas and their usage.</p><br>

<h2>Cooking</h2>
<h3 style="text-decoration: blink;color: #a37303; text-align: center;">Baking</h3>
<p>
Baking is a wonderful way to spark a lifelong love of the kitchen in your children. I love to make muffins and cookies. In my life baking and cooking is like therapy that gives me relaxation and happiness. It's messy (and therefore fun!) and the results are hard to resist.</p>

<h2>Fitness</h2>
<p>
All fitness is acquired through a process of physical stress and recovery. When you exercise, your body is required to do things that it does not normally do when you are resting. <br>
<strong>Running has been shown to have the following health benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>lower levels of body fat and obesity;</li>
<li>lower risk of heart disease and stroke;</li>
<li>stronger bones, reducing the risk of osteoporosis, </li>
<li>osteoarthritis and other bone deficiencies;</li>
<li>reduced risk of diseases such as cancer and diabetes;</li>
<li>improved immune system;</li>
<li>stronger muscles, and less risk of degradation of joints;</li>
<li>reduced risk of back pain;</li>
<li>reduced incidence of depression and anxiety;</li>
<li>increased coordination and mobility, especially in older adults.</li> 
</ul>
